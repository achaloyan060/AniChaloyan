      <h2>Childhood</h2>
     
      <p>  I was born on November 22, 1999, in a small country called Armenia. As  a child, I enjoyed exploring and discovering new things, singing, dancing, and doing math. I went to school in Armenia until 6th grade. In 2010, my family and I moved to the United States as my dad got a job offer. I went to Hyde Middle School and graduated in 2013. </p>

      <h2>Moving to US</h2>
      <p>In 2010, when I was 10 years old, my dad got a job offer from Unisys and my family and I moved to the United States. I started going to Hyde Middle School; I was placed in the school's English Language Development program and improved my English skills over the years. Even though it was challenging for me to leave my homeland and live in a new place, I soon got used to the lifestyle in America.</p>

      <h2>ME Life</h2>
      <p> After graduating middle school in 2013, I started attending to Cupertino High School (I'm currently a rising senior). I learned a lot from the challenges I faced during my high school years and discovered my passion - computer science. As a Junior, I took Java and fell in love with programming. I began spending more of my time coding and decided to major in computer science in the future. </p>
